### Hello, my name is Pete Voulgaris ðŸ‘‹. I am a senior principle/team lead/software architect/engineer with many interests.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working for a large investment management firm in the Investment & Trade Compliance space, doing C# .NET development (mix of Framework and Core), Web Services, AWS lambdas, step functions, SNS, SQS, SQL Server, PostgreSQL, etc.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently interesting in expanding my skills in F#, Rust, C++, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript and R (to name a few ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„ðŸ˜„)...but seriously, I have a lot of interests and love learning new things!
- I've recently installed Linux Mint Cinnamon on an old laptop (overwriting Windows) and so far, it's been great! So much less cruft and useless background processes eating-up resources, than my usual Windows machine(s).
